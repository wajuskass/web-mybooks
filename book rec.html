<!--HTML is the predominant mark up language for web pages. HTML creates structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text like headings, lists, links, quotes etc. It allows images and objects to be embedded to create interactive forms. It is written as tags surrounded by angle brackets - for example, <html>. Scripts in languages like JavaScript can also be loaded.
XHTML is a family of XML languages which extend or mirror versions of HTML. It does not allow omission of any tags or use of attribute minimization. XHTML requires that there be an end tag to every start tag and all nested tags must be closed in the right order. For example, while <br> is valid in HTML, it would be required to write <br /> in XHTML.
HTML and XHTML specifications are the standards that define the syntax and semantics of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), respectively. They are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
The latest versions of the HTML and XHTML specifications are known as HTML5 and XHTML5, respectively. These specifications are the basis for all modern web browsers, and define the standard for how HTML documents are structured and processed.
HTML documents are composed of elements that have three components- a pair of element tags – start tag, end tag; element attributes given within tags and actual, textual and graphic content. HTML element is everything that lies between and including tags. (Tag is a keyword which is enclosed within angle brackets).
XHTML documents has only one root element. All elements including variables must be in lower case, and values assigned must be surrounded by quotation marks, closed and nested for being recognized. This is a mandatory requirement in XHTML unlike HTML where it is optional. The declaration of DOCTYPE would determine rules for documents to follow.
HTML and XHTML are closely related and therefore can be documented together. Both HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 have three sub specifications – strict, loose and frameset. The difference opening declarations for a document distinguishes HTML and XHTML. Other differences are syntactic. HTML allows shortcuts like elements with optional tags, empty elements without end tags. XHTML is very strict about opening and closing tags. XHTML uses built in language defining functionality attribute. All syntax requirements of XML are included in a well formed XHTML document.
HTML versions 
HTML 1.0 or first version of HTML was a version of SGML that had ability to link different document or pages using 'href'.
HTML 1.0 had 20 elements or tags, now latest version of HTML, ie HTML5 has a lot more.
HTML 2.0 After HTML 1.0, the second version of HTML was released in 1994. HTML 2.0 was an expansion of HTML 1.0.
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) was behind it's creation.
HTML 3.2 was released In 1997. HTML 3.2 had many new features like tables, superscript, subscript etc.
Two most important features introduced in HTML 3.2 were tables and text flow around images.
Tables were widely used and programmers still use them but it is not recommended anymore. In HTML5 div tags and other semantic elements are used more frequently instead of table element.
HTML 4.01 was released In 1999. HTML 4.01 introduced features like scripting, style sheets, better tables, better forms frames and embedding objects. HTML 4.01 was a revised version of HTML 4.0, it also included features for the disabled people to enhance their interactivity with the Global world through Internet.
HTML5 was released in 2014. HTML5 is the best version of HTML up till now. HTML5 improved user interactivity so much and also lessened the burden of devices.
HTML5 fully supports all kind of media application that are there. HTML5 supports both audio and video media content. HTML5 also provides full support for JavaScript to run in the background.
XHTML version 
XHTML 1.0 December 1998 saw the publication of a W3C Working Draft entitled Reformulating HTML in XML. This introduced Voyager, the codename for a new markup language based on HTML 4, but adhering to the stricter syntax rules of XML. By February 1999 the name of the specification had changed to XHTML 1.0: The Extensible HyperText Markup Language, and in January 2000 it was officially adopted as a W3C Recommendation. There are three formal DTDs for XHTML 1.0, corresponding to the three different versions of HTML 4.01:
•	XHTML 1.0 Strict is the XML equivalent to strict HTML 4.01, and includes elements and attributes that have not been marked deprecated in the HTML 4.01 specification. As of November 2015, XHTML 1.0 Strict is the document type used for the homepage of the website of the World Wide Web Consortium.
•	XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Transitional, and includes the presentational elements (such as center, font and strike) excluded from the strict version.
•	XHTML 1.0 Frameset is the XML equivalent of HTML 4.01 Frameset, and allows for the definition of frameset documents—a common Web feature in the late 1990s.
The second edition of XHTML 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in August 2002
